# SchoologyCookieExploit

# This script will scrape an entire schoology web page given a session cookie, found within a user's web browser.
# This script will bypasss the login of schoology, allowing you to write scripts for whatever purpose you may need (hopefully not nefarious...).
# This script is not super useful by itself, and is not intended to be. This is really only a proof-of-concept.
